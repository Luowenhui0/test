Beijing velvet flower

"Beijing velvet flower" originated in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, made of silkworm velvet with copper wire as the skeleton. It was first popular in the Qing Dynasty and gradually formed a unique artistic style with more than 300 years of history. Later, the types of velvet crafts continued to expand, and the modelling theme was mainly birds, so it was also commonly known as "velvet birds". It is also called "Palace Flower" because it entered the palace as a tribute from the imperial court. Most of these flannel flowers are based on auspicious patterns such as "auspicious celebration", "dragon and Phoenix are auspicious", coupled with the homonym of "flannel" and "glory", wearing flannel meant glory and wealth, so many people wore flannel flowers at that time.
